Carbon Footprint Calculator for Transport

Overview :

This project is a Carbon Footprint Calculator that estimates the CO₂ emissions generated by transport based on the type of transport, distance traveled, and the weight of the load. It helps to understand the environmental impact of transportation logistics by calculating the carbon footprint in kilograms of CO₂.

Features
Transport Types:

FTL (Full Truck Load): Used for large shipments, where the truck is fully loaded.
LTL (Less Than Truck Load): Used for smaller shipments, where the truck is partially loaded.
Inputs:

Distance: The distance traveled in kilometers (KM).
Load Weight: The weight of the load in kilograms (KG).
Output:

The program calculates and displays the CO₂ emissions generated for the selected transport type, distance, and load weight.
How it Works
Select Transport Type:

Choose between FTL or LTL based on your transport method.
Enter Transport Details:

Input the distance (in kilometers) the transport will cover.
Input the load weight (in kilograms).
CO₂ Emission Calculation:

Based on the inputs, the program computes the CO₂ emissions in kilograms, using an average emission rate for FTL and LTL transport types.
Result:

The program outputs the calculated CO₂ emissions in kg, providing insight into the environmental impact of the transport operation.



Requirements :
 * Python 3.x
 * How to Use
 * Clone or download the repository.
 * Run the Python script carbon_footprint_calculator.py.
 * Follow the prompts to input the transport type, distance, and load weight.
 * View the calculated CO₂ emissions.
